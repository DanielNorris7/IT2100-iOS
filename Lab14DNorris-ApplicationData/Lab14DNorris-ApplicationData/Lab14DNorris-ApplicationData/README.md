#  Application Data Lab
    - UserDefaults: This is shown by the toggle and the slider to change the color. 
    -- Note the color is defaulted to a specific color
    
    - Setting bundles: This is shown by letting the user select an Apple Image from the Settings > Lab14DNorris -XXX options
        -- This is defaulted to the "NewSchool" Apple Image, but can be changed.
    
    - Direct File System Access: To show this functionality I added a text field that the user can type in. Then I added a button to save
    the data and a second to display it.
